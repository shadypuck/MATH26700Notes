\chapter{Character Theory}
\section{Characters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{10/9:}Today, we talk about \textbf{characters}, arguably the most important idea in rep theory.
    \item As per usual, we begin by letting $G$ a finite group.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We've been discussing finite dimensional representations of $G$ over $\C$.
        \item We've also already talked about irreps, and we know that it's enough to understand those because every rep is a sum of them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Goal of characters: Understand the irreps $V_1,\dots,V_k$ of $G$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall the surprising fact about $k$: It is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We haven't yet proven this, but we will soon!
        \end{itemize}
        \item Game plan: Use characters to relate irreps to something that is counted by conjugacy classes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let $V=\C e_1\oplus\cdots\oplus\C e_n$ be a $G$-rep.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Then there exists a homomorphism $\rho:g\mapsto A_g\in GL_n(\C)$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Motivating question: What doesn't change when we change the basis of $V$?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To isolate the "essence" of the $A_g$, we want to construct a function $f:GL_n(\C)\to\C$ such that $f(XAX^{-1})=f(A)$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ideas.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The determinant is a great example of such a function, but it's kind of boring because this rank 1 representation doesn't characterize your product representation.
        \item Trace is the main example of such a function.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Indeed, you can also take $\tr(A^k)$ for any $k$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traces of powers are ubiquitous in physics and math because they contain the same information as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. In particular, we can express the determinant in terms of them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item In fact, we could also take any coefficient of the characteristic polynomial, but others would get complicated.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Any characteristic polynomial coefficient can be expressed in terms of traces; this will be an exercise in PSet 3; it's not hard.
    \end{itemize}
    \item So what do we have at this point?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can associate to $\rho$ a function $\chi_\rho:G\to\C$ defined by $\chi_\rho(g)=\tr(A_g)=\tr(\rho(g))$.
        \item This function is invariant under isomorphism.
        \item If we know $\tr(A)$, we know $\tr(A^2)$ since $A_g^2=A_{g^2}$. Thus, if we know all traces, we know all power traces.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Something about the following??
            \begin{equation*}
                \sum\lambda_i\lambda_j = \frac{\tr(A)^2-\tr(A^2)}{2}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{itemize}
        \item We form a ring of polynomials??
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Equivalently, $\chi_\rho$ has a representation as a polynomial with coefficients in $\C$??
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item If $V$ is a $G$-rep, $\chi_V:G\to\C$ will be our notation for its character.
    \item Properties.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\chi_V(xgx^{-1})=\chi_V(g)$ for any $x,g\in G$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implication: $\chi_V$ is a \textbf{class function}.
            \item Let $\C[G]$ be the vector space of all functions from $G\to\C$. Its $\dim=|G|$.
            \item Inside this space, there is the subspace $\C_\text{cl}[G]$ of functions $f:G\to\C$ such that $f(xgx^{-1})=f(g)$ for all $x,g\in G$. These are functions from the sets of conjugacy classes, isomorphic to functions that are constant on conjugacy classes. $\dim\C_\text{cl}[G]$ is the number of conjugacy classes.
            \item Thus, for every $V$ a $G$-rep, we get a vector $\chi_V\in\C_\text{cl}[G]$. These class functions form a basis of the space; each $\chi_V$ for $V$ an irrep forms a linearly independent vector; the set is an \emph{orthogonal} basis. This is the reason for the original theorem holding true!
        \end{itemize}
        \item $\chi_{V_1\oplus V_2}=\chi_{V_1}+\chi_{V_2}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proof: It's basically tautological (not actually, but it's easy). Let $g\in G$. Compute $\chi_{V_1\oplus V_2}(g)$. We can compute a basis $e_1,\dots,e_{n+m}$ where the first $n$ vectors form a basis of $V_1$, and the next $m$ vectors are a basis of $V_2$. This gives us a block matrix from which we show that the trace of the matrix is the sum of traces.
            \begin{equation*}
                \chi_{V_1\oplus V_2}(g) = \tr
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    \rho_{V_1}(g) & 0\\
                    0 & \rho_{V_2}(g)\\
                \end{bmatrix}
                = \tr\rho_{V_1}(g)+\tr\rho_{V_2}(g)
                = \chi_{V_1}(g)+\chi_{V_2}(g)
            \end{equation*}
            \item Corollary:
            \begin{equation*}
                \chi_{V_1^{n_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus V_k^{n_k}} = n_1\chi_{V_1}+\cdots+n_k\chi_{V_k}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item We now pause for a fact that will be instrumental in proving the next property, which is a bit more involved.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He will explain two ways to prove it; we can also just prove it on our own.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fact: $A$ a matrix such that $A^n=1$. Then $A$ is diagonalizable or "semi-simple."
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can prove this with Jordan normal form.
        \item It's a slightly surprising statement.
        \item Obviously eigenvalues are roots of unity, but still needs some work.
        \item This proof is left as an exercise.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now resume the list of properties.
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item $\chi_V(g)$ is a sum of roots of unity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proof: We know that $g^{|G|}=e$. Thus, $A_g^{|G|}=1$. It follows by the fact above that $A_g$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$, each of which satisfies $\lambda_i^{|G|}=1$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Note: Eigenvalues can repeat in the list $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$, i.e., we are not asserting $n$ distinct eigenvalues here.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Therefore, since each $\lambda_i$ is, individually, a root of unity, we have that $\chi_V(g)=\tr A_g=\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_n$, as desired.
        \end{itemize}
        \item $\chi_{V^*}=\bar{\chi}_V$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This property begins to address how characters behave under other operations.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Naturally, this is something specific for complex numbers, because the idea of "conjugates" doesn't exist everywhere.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Proof: Recall that $\rho_{V^*}(g)=(\rho_V(g)^{-1})^T$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If we know that $\rho_V(G)\sim\diag(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$, then we know that $\rho_V^{-1}(g)^T\sim\diag(\lambda_1^{-1},\dots,\lambda_n^{-1})$.
                \item Thus, $\chi_{V^*}(g)=\lambda_1^{-1}+\cdots+\lambda_n^{-1}$.
                \item But since we're in the complex plane, $|\lambda_i|=1$ (equiv. $\lambda_i\bar{\lambda}_i=1$), so $\lambda_i^{-1}=1/\lambda_i=\bar{\lambda}_i$.
                \item This means that $\chi_{V^*}(g)=\bar{\lambda}_1+\cdots+\bar{\lambda}_n=\overline{\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_n}$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Note: Every representation we have is \textbf{unitary} in certain bases, but unitary representations are not covered in this course.
        \end{itemize}
        \item $\chi_{V_1\otimes V_2}=\chi_{V_1}\cdot\chi_{V_2}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proof: We can use a basis or not use a basis.
            \item Let's use a basis for now.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Let $g\in G$ be arbitrary. Then there exist bases $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $V_1$ and $f_1,\dots,f_m$ of $V_2$ such that $\rho_{V_1}(g)$ and $\rho_{V_2}(g)$ are diagonal.
                \item It follows that $\rho_{V_1}(g)e_i=\lambda_ie_i$ ($i=1,\dots,n$) and $\rho_{V_2}(g)f_i=\mu_if_i$ ($i=1,\dots,m$).
                \item $V_1\otimes V_2$ thus has basis $e_i\otimes f_j$.
                \item But then it follows that $\rho_{V_1\otimes V_2}(g)e_i\otimes f_j=(\lambda_ie_i)\otimes(\mu_jf_j)=\lambda_i\mu_j(e_i\otimes f_j)$.
                \item Thus,
                \begin{equation*}
                    \tr(\rho_{V_1\otimes V_2}(g)) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n,m}\lambda_i\mu_j
                    = (\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_n)(\mu_1+\cdots+\mu_m)
                    = \tr(\rho_{V_1}(g))\cdot\tr(\rho_{V_2}(g))
                \end{equation*}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Alternate approach.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If we don't want to think of eigenvalues, think of tensor product of matrices, the Kronecker product.
                \item We get trace is the product of traces once again! \emph{Write this out.}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Class function}: A function on a group $G$ that is constant on the conjugacy classes of $G$.
    \item Examples.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $A$ be an abelian group.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Then $\chi:A\to\C^\times$.
            \item Implication: Character of a character is $\chi_\chi=\chi$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This is horribly repetitive but true.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item $G=S_3$.

            \label{tab:charTableS3}
        \end{table}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The conjugacy classes of this group are $\{e\}$, $\{(12),(13),(23)\}$, and $\{(123),(132)\}$.
            \item We construct a \textbf{character table} to define all characters.
            \item Computing the characters for the trivial representation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item We know that $\rho$ sends each $g$ to the matrix $(1)$, which has trace 1.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Computing the characters for the sign representation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $e$ and $(123)$ have sign 1 and thus get sent to the matrix $(1)$.
                \item $(12)$ has sign $-1$ and thus gets sent to the matrix $(-1)$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Computing the characters for the standard representation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item We can compute these traces via a thought experiment.
                \item Visualize a triangle in a plane.
                \item The $2\times 2$ identity matrix (the standard representation of $e\in G$) acts on it by doing nothing, and has trace 2.
                \item In \emph{some} basis, our matrix fixes one vector and inverts another, so matrix is
                \begin{equation*}
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        1 & 0\\
                        0 & -1\\
                    \end{pmatrix}
                \end{equation*}
                and character is 0.
                \item Last one is rotation by $2\pi/3$, so
                \begin{equation*}
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        \cos(2\pi/3) & \sin(2\pi/3)\\
                        -\sin(2\pi/3) & \cos(2\pi/3)\\
                    \end{pmatrix}
                \end{equation*}
                so character is $-1=2\cdot -1/2=2\cdot\cos(2\pi/3)$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item If $V$ is the standard representation, we can also compute the characters of $V^{\otimes 2}$ for instance. Indeed, by the product rule of characters, they will be the squares of the standard representation's characters, i.e., $(4,0,1)$.
            \item Similarly, since the permutational representation is the direct sum of the standard and trivial representations, we can add their characters to get its characters $(3,1,0)$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item A very general and very pretty example. Let $G\acts X$ a finite set.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Assign the permutational representation.
            \item Let $X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$. Think of these elements as the basis of a vector space; in particular, consider $V=\C e_{x_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus\C e_{x_n}$. Recall that $g(a_1e_{x_1}+\cdots+a_ne_{x_n})=a_1e_{gx_1}+\cdots+a_ne_{gx_n}$. The fact that this is a representation follows immediately from the properties of the group action.
            \item Computing the character $\chi_V$ of this $V$: Look at $g$ and write its matrix. In particular, the trace is the number of unmoved/fixed elements, sometimes denoted $\Fix(g)$.
            \item This gives us another way of computing $V_\text{perm}$ from above!
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Character table}: A table that lists the conjugacy classes across the top, the irreps down the left side, and at each point within it, the value of an irrep's character over that conjugacy class.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The character table is a very nice matrix with very nice properties.
        \item It is almost orthogonal; not exactly, but very close.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rows aren't orthogonal, but columns are (take direct products)!
            \item It is full rank, though.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item The midterm: Take the character table and do fun things with it.
\end{itemize}



\section{Office Hours}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{10/10:}Problem 1b:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Canonically self-dual: $V\cong V^*$ canonically.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mathematical methods of quantum mechanics: First few paragraphs of \emph{picture}.
    \item We should have everything we need to do most of the problem set at this point; maybe not all of 5, but maybe yes, too.
    \item Problem 3:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is some problem where it decomposes into trivial plus standard, but we still have to prove that standard is irreducible in this case!
        \item If you have any vector, you can produce out of this vector something else.
        \item If we take any vector and the group acts on it, we'll get a basis. If you hit a vector in the invariant subspace, it will just stay there; if you hit it and it goes everywhere, you get a basis.
        \item Now think about a vector when you permute its coordinates.
        \item Tomorrow in class, we will learn a quick way to do this problem.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Problem 5:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For some problem, we need to use the fact that $A^n=1$ proves that $A=I$ in some sense.
        \item This is a hard problem!
        \item Show that eigenvalues sum to 1; we know that the eigenvalues are roots of unity! Thus, they have to both be 1!
        \item When the problem in group theory is harder, that's when you need to go to rep theory.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Characters are Orthonormal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{10/11:}Announcement: Zoom OH today.
    \item Recap: The big picture.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Representations.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We have representations, which are vector spaces on which a group acts.
            \item With these representations, we can do a bunch of operations we've discussed: $\oplus,\otimes,V^*,\Lambda^n,S^n$.
            \item We'll focus on the first 3 for now, though.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Class functions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We also have class functions: Functions $f:G\to\C$ such that for all $g,x\in G$, $f(gxg^{-1})=f(x)$.
            \item The space of class functions forms a ring, since you can add, multiply, and take the complex conjugate of these functions.
            \item Moreover, this ring is a vector space and it has dimension equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The big idea: These two things (representations and class functions) are closely related!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There is a map, called a \emph{character}, that pairs a representation to a class function.
            \item Indeed, $V\to\chi_V$.
            \item Under this map, operations of representations become operations of functions:
            \begin{align*}
                \oplus &\mapsto +&
                \otimes &\mapsto \cdot&
                V^* &\mapsto \bar{f}
            \end{align*}
            \item Additionally, $V_1,\dots,V_s$ become $\chi_{V_1},\dots,\chi_{V_s}$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Theorem we will prove over the next couple of lectures: Irreps become \emph{linearly independent} class functions, and all irreps form a basis of the space of class functions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This theorem is huge! It is our main takeaway for now.
        \item For the first part of the course, this is the main thing that we should remember.
    \end{itemize}
    \item How do we prove that multiple vectors are linearly independent?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A strong condition would be to introduce an inner product and prove that the pairwise inner product of the vectors is zero.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Orthonormal basis}: A basis for which $\inp{e_i,e_j}=\delta_{ij}$.
    \item Let's begin carrying out this plan by defining an inner product on $\C[G]$. Indeed, let $f_1,f_2$ be two functions on $G$ and take
    \begin{equation*}
        \inp{f_1,f_2} := \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}f_1(g)\overline{f_2(g)}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Motivation for this definition.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall the \textbf{Hermitian inner product} on $\C^n$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We are essentially mapping $f_1,f_2$ to $(f_1(g_1),\dots,f_1(g_{|G|})),(f_2(g_1),\dots,f_2(g_{|G|}))\in\C^{|G|}$ and taking the Hermitian inner product there.
            \item Thus, we can see that all properties hold for both the Hermitian inner product on $\C^n$ and the one defined above on $\C[G]$.
            \item In other words, this kind of construction should inherit its status as a linear, positive definite bilinear form from the Hermitian inner product.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Note: The Hermitian product above is \textbf{$\bm{G}$-invariant}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This means that the functions on $G$ from $G\to\C$ in $\C[G]$ form a representation of $G$.
            \item In particular, if $\varphi:G\to\C$, then $g=\rho(g)$ moves it as follows: $g\cdot\varphi=\varphi^g$ where $\varphi^g(h):=\varphi(g^{-1}h)$. Thus, we have an action of $G$ on every $\varphi$!
            \item Such representations are isomorphic for finite groups??
        \end{itemize}
        \item If we have $\inp{f_1,f_2}$, we can ask if
        \begin{equation*}
            \inp{f_1,f_2} \stackrel{?}{=} \inp{f_1^g,f_2^g}
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Left as an exercise that this \emph{is} true!
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hermitian inner product} (on $\C^n$): The inner product defined as follows for all $z,w\in\C^n$. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{\inp{\ ,\ }}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \inp{z,w} = \sum_{i=1}^nz_i\bar{w}_i
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This inner product gives a complex number $\inp{v,w}\in\C$ with the following properties.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\inp{a_1v_1+a_2v_2,w}=a_1\inp{v_1,w}+a_2\inp{v_2,w}$.
            \item $\inp{v,b_1w_1+b_2w_2}=\bar{b}_1\inp{v,w_1}+\bar{b}_2\inp{v,w_2}$.
            \item $\inp{v,v}\geq 0$, and $\inp{v,v}=0$ implies that $v=0$.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Thus, if $v=(z_1,\dots,z_n)$ and $w=(w_1,\dots,w_n)$, then
        \begin{align*}
            \inp{v,w} &= \sum z_i\bar{w}_i&
            \inp{v,v} &= \sum|z_i|^2
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now begin tackling today's main theorem: If $V_1,V_2$ are irreps, then
    \begin{equation*}
        \inp{\chi_{V_1},\chi_{V_2}} =
        \begin{cases}
            0 & V_1\ncong V_2\\
            1 & V_1\cong V_2
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will prove this theorem in stages.
        \item The general outline of our approach is to deduce the equality step by step through the transitive property. Some of the equalities we'll eventually end up needing are easier to discuss on their own first, though, so we begin with some lemmas.
    \end{itemize}
    \item First off, recall the \textbf{space of invariants} from PSet 2.
    \item \textbf{Space of invariants} (of a representation $V$): The vector space defined as follows. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{V^G}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        V^G = \{v\in V\mid gv=v\ \forall\ g\in G\}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Lemma 1: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ be a finite-dimensional representation of it, and let $p$ be defined as above. Then $p\in\Hom_G(V,V)$.
    \begin{proof}
        We can view $p$ as an element of $\Hom(V,V)$. This combined with the fact that for every $h\in G$,
        \begin{equation*}
            p(hv) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}(gh)v
            = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{gh\in G}(gh)v
            = \frac{1}{|G|}h\sum_{g\in G}gv
            = h(pv)
        \end{equation*}
        implies that $p\in\Hom_G(V,V)$. In more formal notation,
        \begin{align*}
            [p\circ\rho_V(h)](v) &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}[\rho_V(g)\circ\rho_V(h)](v)\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}[\rho_V(gh)](v)\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{gh\in G}[\rho_V(gh)](v)\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{hg\in G}[\rho_V(hg)](v)\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}[\rho_V(hg)](v)\\
            &= [\rho_V(h)]\left( \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}[\rho_V(g)](v) \right)\\
            &= [\rho_V(h)\circ p](v)
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
    \item Why do we need this result?? What does it do for the rest of the proof?
    \item Lemma 2: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ be a finite-dimensional representation of it. Then the map $p$, defined as follows, is a projector from $V\to V^G$.
    \begin{equation*}
        p = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}g = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\rho_V(g)
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        To prove that $p$ is a projector, it will suffice to show that $p^2=p$. To prove that $p$ projects onto $V^G$, it will suffice to show that $\im(p)=V^G$. Let's begin.\par
        To show that $p^2=p$, we have
        \begin{equation*}
            p^2 = \left( \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}g \right)^2
            = \frac{1}{|G|^2}\sum_{g_1,g_2\in G}g_1g_2
            = \frac{|G|}{|G|^2}\sum_{g\in G}g
            = p
        \end{equation*}
        Note that since $G$ is not abelian (i.e., $g_1g_2\neq g_2g_1$ in all cases), the square of $\sum g$ is as above and cannot be reduced to a smaller sum with a 2 coefficient or something like that. Additionally, note that $\sum_{g_1,g_2\in G}g_1g_2=|G|\sum g$ since for each $g_i$, $g_i(g_1+\cdots+g_{|G|})=g_1+\cdots+g_{|G|}$.\par
        To show that $\im(p)=V^G$, we will use a bidirectional inclusion proof. To confirm that $\im(p)\subset V^G$, we have for any $h\in G$ that
        \begin{equation*}
            h\left( \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}gv \right) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{hg\in G}hgv
            = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}gv
        \end{equation*}
        from which it follows that
        \begin{equation*}
            p(v) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum gv \in V^G
        \end{equation*}
        as desired. To confirm that $V^G\subset\im(p)$, let $v\in V^G$. Then $gv=v$. It follows that
        \begin{equation*}
            v = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}v
            = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}gv
            = p(v)
            \in \im(p)
        \end{equation*}
        as desired.
    \end{proof}
    \item You differentiated the first and second parts of the above proof by saying, "this is the algebraic way to prove it; we can also prove it nonalgebraically." Does this mean that $p^2=p$ somehow \emph{implies} $\im(p)=V^G$ here, or do we still need to prove that "nonalgebraically," as in \textcite{bib:FultonHarris}??
    \item Consequence of Lemma 2: There's a very easy way to construct invariant factors.
    \item We now prove one final lemma using what we have learned about $p$.
    \item Lemma 3: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ be a finite-dimensional representation of it. Then $\dim V^G=(1/|G|)\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)$.
    \begin{proof}
        Define $p$ as above. Then
        \begin{align*}
            \dim V^G &= \dim(\im(p))\tag*{Lemma 2}\\
            &= \tr(p)\tag*{PSet 1, Q5c}\\
            &= \tr(\frac{1}{|G|}\sum\rho_V(g))\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\tr(\rho_V(g))\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)
        \end{align*}
        as desired.
    \end{proof}
    \item We can now prove the main result.
    \item Theorem: If $V,W$ are irreps, then
    \begin{equation*}
        \inp{\chi_V,\chi_W} =
        \begin{cases}
            0 & V\ncong W\\
            1 & V\cong W
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        % \par\smallskip
        % We could derive this formula, but we'll just state it for now. Let's begin.\par\smallskip
        % Let $G$ be a finite group and let $V$ be a representation of $G$.
        % We want to be able to compute something about this representation. Suppose we want to understand the space of invariants from PSet 2. How do we compute the dimension of $V^G$? Close to what we discussed when we proved the complete reducibility theorem.\par

        % \begin{equation*}
        %     p = \sum_{g\in G}\rho_V(g)
        %     = \sum_{g\in G}\rho_V(hgh^{-1})
        %     = \sum_{g\in G}\rho_V(h)\circ\rho_V(g)\circ\rho_V(h^{-1})
        %     = \rho_V(h)\circ p\circ\rho_V(h^{-1})
        % \end{equation*}
        
        % \par
        % Let $V,W$ be two representations. Try to understand $\Hom_G(V,W)$. Recall that the dimension is 1 if $V\cong G$ and ?? otherwise. We have that
        % \begin{equation*}
        %     \dim(\Hom_G(V,W)) = \dim([\Hom_F(V,W)]^G)
        % \end{equation*}
        % This is almost a tautology, but it requires care, regardless.
        % We have
        % \begin{align*}
        %     \dim([\Hom_F(V,W)]^G) &= \dim((V^*\otimes W)^G)\\
        %     &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_{V^*\otimes W}(g)\\
        %     &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_{V^*}(g)\cdot\chi_W(g)\\
        %     &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\overline{\chi_V(g)}\cdot\chi_W(g)\\
        %     &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)\cdot\overline{\chi_W(g)}\\
        %     &= \inp{\chi_V,\chi_W}
        % \end{align*}
        % Note that the third-to-last term is an integer, so we can rearrange it to the second-to-last term??\par
        % This implies immediately the theorem via \hyperref[lem:Schur]{Schur's Lemma}.


        We will work towards a formula for the inner product, using various results that we've proven up until now. Let's begin.
        \begin{align*}
            \inp{\chi_V,\chi_W} &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)\cdot\overline{\chi_W(g)}\tag*{Definition}\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g)\cdot\chi_{W^*}(g)\tag*{Property 4}\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_{V\otimes W^*}(g)\tag*{Property 5}\\
            &= \dim[(V\otimes W^*)^G]\tag*{Lemma 3}\\
            &= \dim([\Hom_F(V,W)]^G)\tag*{Lecture 2.1}\\
            &= \dim[\Hom_G(V,W)]\tag*{PSet 2, Q4b}\\
            &=
            \begin{cases}
                \dim(\spn(I)) & V\cong W\\
                \dim(\spn(0)) & V\ncong W
            \end{cases}
            \tag*{Schur's Lemma}\\
            &=
            \begin{cases}
                0 & V\ncong W\\
                1 & V\cong W
            \end{cases}
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
    \item In the above proof, Rudenko first surveys the following special case. Why??
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Then if $V$ is irreducible and trivial, we have
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_V(g) = 0
        \end{equation*}
        which happens iff
        \begin{equation*}
            \inp{\chi_V,\chi_\text{triv}} = 0
        \end{equation*}
        whereas
        \begin{equation*}
            \inp{\chi_\text{triv},\chi_\text{triv}} = 1
        \end{equation*}
        This proves the theorem in a special case, but how do we go from here to all representations? We're very close!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Corollary: The number of irreps is less than or equal to the number of conjugacy classes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We'll leave it to next time to prove that equality holds.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Whenever we have a sec, we should try to form a mental picture the whole class function thing.
    \item Consequence of the theorem: We get an orthogonality relation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\chi_1,\chi_2$ are characters if irreps, then
        \begin{equation*}
            \sum_{g\in G}\chi_1(g)\overline{\chi_2(g)} =
            \begin{cases}
                0 & \chi_1\neq\chi_2\\
                |G| & \chi_1=\chi_2
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        \item This is related to the character table and IChem!!! Example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Recall Table \ref{tab:charTableS3}, the character table for $S_3$.
            \item Between the trivial and alternating representations, we have
            \begin{equation*}
                (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(1)(1) = 0
            \end{equation*}
            as expected. Note that we have a term for each element in $S_3$, so some products get repeated multiple times.
            \item For the standard representation, we have
            \begin{equation*}
                (2)(2)+(0)(0)+(0)(0)+(0)(0)+(-1)(-1)+(-1)(-1) = 6 = |S_3|
            \end{equation*}
            as expected.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Theorem: Characters are equal iff their representations are isomorphic.
    \item Next time.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prove the theorem.
        \item Consequences.
        \item Implications for the character table.

        \caption{The stories of representation theory.}
        \label{fig:RepTheoryStory}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $G$ be a finite group.
        \item First story: We study finite-dimensional representations of $G$ over $\C$; these are vector spaces, so we can direct sum, tensor multiply, and dualize them.
        \item Second story: We study class functions $\C_\text{cl}[G]=\{f:G\to\C\mid f(gxg^{-1})=f(x)\}$; these are elements of a ring, so we can add, multiply, and conjugate them.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Last thing: We have the Hermitian product
            \begin{equation*}
                \inp{f_1,f_2} = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}f_1(g)\overline{f_2(g)}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{itemize}
        \item We can map between these two stories: Representations become characters, $\oplus\mapsto +$, $\otimes\mapsto\cdot$, and $V^*\mapsto\bar{f}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Theorem (from last time):
    \begin{equation*}
        \inp{\chi_{V_1},\chi_{V_2}} = \dim\Hom_G(V_1,V_2)
    \end{equation*}
    \item The story in Figure \ref{fig:RepTheoryStory} tells us stuff about representations.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $V_1,\dots,V_k$ be irreps. Then the vectors $\chi_{V_1},\dots,\chi_{V_k}$ are orthonormal.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We get this result with the Theorem above and \hyperref[lem:Schur]{Schur's Lemma}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Next time, we'll prove that $\chi_{V_1},\dots,\chi_{V_k}$ spans $\C_\text{cl}[G]$, i.e., the number of irreps is the number of conjugacy classes.
        \item \emph{Cube thing??}
        \item This picture is remarkable because it's so simple.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now look at some corollaries to last time's main theorem.
    \item Corollary 1: If $V,W$ are $G$-reps, then $\chi_V=\chi_W$ iff $V\cong W$.
    \begin{proof}
        Invoking complete reducibility, we have that $V=\bigoplus V_i^{n_i}$. Thus, to know $V$, it is enough to know the $n_i$'s. But
        \begin{equation*}
            \chi_V = \sum n_i\chi_{V_i}
        \end{equation*}
        where
        \begin{equation*}
            n_i = n_i\cdot 1 = n_i\inp{\chi_{V_i},\chi_{V_i}} = \inp{\chi_V,\chi_{V_i}}
        \end{equation*}
        Therefore, since the $\chi_{V_i}$ are linearly independent, the only way that $\chi_V=\chi_W$ is if the $n_i$'s match which would mean that $V\cong W$, and vice versa the only way that $V\cong W$ is if the $n_i$'s match which would mean that $\chi_V=\chi_W$.
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary 2: Let $V$ be a $G$-rep. Then TFAE:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $V$ is irreducible.
        \item $\inp{\chi_V,\chi_V}=1$.
        \item $\sum_{g\in G}|\chi_V(g)|^2=|G|$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{proof}
        ($1\Rightarrow 2$): We have that
        \begin{equation*}
            \inp{\chi_V,\chi_V} = \dim\Hom_G(V,V) = 1
        \end{equation*}
        as desired.\par
        ($2\Rightarrow 1$): Complete reducibility implies that $V\cong V_1^{n_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus V_k^{n_k}$, where the $V_i$'s are irreps. This combined with the hypothesis implies that
        \begin{equation*}
            1 = \inp{\chi_V,\chi_V}
            = \inp{\sum_{i=1}^kn_i\chi_{V_i},\sum_{i=1}^kn_i\chi_{V_i}}
            = \sum_{i=1}^kn_i^2
        \end{equation*}
        But if $\sum n_i^2=1$ where each $n_i\in\Z^+$, then $n_i=1$ for some $i$ and $n_j=0$ for $j\neq i$, from which it follows that $V\cong V_i$.\par
        We can interconvert between 2 and 3 using the definition of the inner product and the property of complex numbers that $zz^*=|z|^2$.
    \end{proof}
    \item We now build up to one final corollary.
    \item We've discussed all of these properties of irreps, but where do we even find them?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We might be able to find some by inspection, but here's how we find all of them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Review: The regular representation. Here are two different but isomorphic ways to think about it.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Think of it as functions on $G$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Better for infinite groups.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Think of it as the permutational representation associated with the action $G\acts G$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Better for finite groups.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Why did we talk about this here??
    \end{itemize}
    \item Corollary 3: Consider the regular representation $V_R$. We have that
    \begin{equation*}
        \chi_{V_R}(g) =
        \begin{cases}
            0 & g\neq e\\
            |G| & g=e
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        We can compute its character $\chi_{V_R}$ by considering the corresponding permutation matrices. Indeed, the action $\chi_{V_R}(g)$ of this character on $g$ is equal to the number of 1's on the diagonal in the permuttion matrix, which is equal to the number of fixed points of the permutation, i.e., the number of $i$'s such that $gg_i=g_i$. But in a group, $gg_i=g_i$ iff $g=e$, so this number of fixed points is
        \begin{equation*}
            \chi_{V_R}(g) = \Fix(g)
            =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                g_1 & \cdots & g_n\\
                gg_1 & \cdots & gg_n\\
            \end{pmatrix}
            =
            \begin{cases}
                0 & g\neq e\\
                |G| & g=e
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        as desired.
    \end{proof}
    \item What is the matrix thing??
    \item We now apply Corollaries 1-3 to the regular representation $V_R$ to obtain some important results.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $V_i$ be an arbitrary irrep.
        \item By complete reducibility, $V_R=\bigoplus_{i=1}^kV_i^{n_i}$ for some set of $n_i$'s.
        \item Additionally,
        \begin{align*}
            n_i &= \inp{\chi_{V_R},\chi_{V_i}}\tag*{Corollary 1}\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\chi_{V_R}(g)\overline{\chi_{V_i}(g)}\\
            &= \frac{1}{|G|}|G|\underbrace{\overline{\chi_{V_i}(e)}}_{\dim V_i}\tag*{Corollary 3}\\
            &= \dim V_i
        \end{align*}
        \item This implies three remarkable results, all worth remembering.
        \begin{align*}
            V_R &= \bigoplus_{i=1}^kV_i^{\dim V_i}&
            |G| &= \sum_{i=1}^k(\dim V_i)^2&
            &\text{\# irreps is finite}
        \end{align*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first result follows directly by substituting $n_i=\dim V_i$ into complete reducibility.
            \item The second result follows because $|G|=\dim(V_R)=\dim(\bigoplus_{i=1}^kV_i^{\dim V_i})=\sum(\dim V_i)^2$.
            \item The third result follows because if there were infinitely many irreps, each with $\dim V_i\geq 1$, then $|G|=\sum_{i=1}^k(\dim V_i)^2=\infty$, contradicting the hypothesis that $|G|$ is finite.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Proof that the number of irreps equals the number of conjugacy classes.
    \item We want to investigate $S_4$, i.e., characterize all irreps of it.

        \label{tab:charTableS4}
    \end{table}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We do so by constructing the character table, Table \ref{tab:charTableS4}.
        \item Initially, this seemed like a very hard problem.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item However, with all of our theory, it only takes a couple of minutes now!
        \end{itemize}
        \item We start by inputting the trivial, sign, and standard representations.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The trivial is obviously $(1,1,1,1,1)$.
            \item The sign can be calculated to be $(1,-1,1,1,-1)$.
            \item The standard is found via $V_\text{std}=V_\text{perm}-V_\text{triv}=(4,2,1,0,0)-(1,1,1,1,1)=(3,1,0,-1,-1)$.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Note that
        \begin{gather*}
            \sum n_i^2 = \inp{\chi_{V_\text{perm}},\chi_{V_\text{perm}}}
                = \frac{1}{24}(1\cdot 4^2+6\cdot 2^2+8\cdot 1^2+0\cdot 0^2+0\cdot 0^2)
                = 2\\
            \inp{\chi_{V_\text{perm}},\chi_{V_\text{sign}}} = \frac{1}{24}(4-12+8)
                = 0\\
            \inp{\chi_{V_\text{perm}},\chi_{V_\text{triv}}} = 1
        \end{gather*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the point of these calculations??
        \end{itemize}
        \item Thus, we can derive representations without having any geometric notion of it using characters!
        \item To see any of these representations geometrically, look at actions on the tetrahedron in $\R^3$!
        \item All those computations above used the \textbf{first orthogonality relation}; here's the \textbf{second orthogonality relation}:
        \begin{equation*}
            \sum_\chi\chi(g_1)\overline{\chi(g_2)} =
            \begin{cases}
                0 & g_1\nsim g_2\\
                \frac{|G|}{|C_G(g)|} & g_1\sim g_2
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        where $\sim$ denotes conjugacy.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prove the new one with $AB=1=BA$. This very simple thing leads to a very powerful statement about systems of equations that we will discuss later. How does this proof work??
            \item We can start doing this stuff in the new homework!
            \item We constructed the fifth representation using this.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Where does the fifth irrep come from?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Going back to a miracle of group theory: Simple groups.
            \item If $f:S_n\to S_n$, we have lots of injective maps, lots of minor actions $S_n\to S_n$ sending $x\mapsto gxg^{-1}$.
            \item We have $\sign:S_n\to S_2$, $S_4\twoheadrightarrow S_3$ with kernel equal to $K_4$.
            \item We have the exotic $S_6\to S_6$.
            \item We have $S_5\hookrightarrow S_6$ that is also exotic.
            \item These are called \textbf{exceptional homomorphisms}.
            \item Since we have $S_4\to S_3$ and $\rho:S_3\to GL_n$, we have $S_4\to GL_n$ with a the same character table. Takeaway: This $(2,0,1)$ thing in the big character table comes from this map, geometrically.
            \item Takeaway: The geometry of the fifth irrep comes from $S_3$.
            \item What is going on here??
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Final announcements.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Going forward, we'll mostly be following \textcite{bib:FultonHarris}.
        \item Then we'll get into associative algebra.
        \item OH next week will be Zoom, but we should still feel free to meet with him in-person by emailing him for an appointment.
